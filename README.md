## Arch Install ##
A simple set of bash scripts to automate the installation of Arch Linux.

Authored for my own personal use and kept simple.


#### TODO ####
* add Btrfs subvolume support to setup.sh
* move "desktop" files into a separate subdirectory instead of being in with "environments"
* split "desktop" files into smaller files (e.g. common, cups, steam, gtk, qt, etc.)
* move current AUR helper file(s), probably to "util", add additional options, and update post-install.txt
* add a snapper configuration script to "util"
* update post-install.txt with options to install items from "util" and other optional items
