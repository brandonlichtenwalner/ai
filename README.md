## Arch Install ##
A simple set of bash scripts to automate the installation of Arch Linux.

Authored for my own personal use and kept simple.


#### TODO ####
* move "desktop" files into a separate subdirectory instead of being in with "environments"
* split "desktop" files into smaller files (e.g. common, cups, steam, gtk, qt, etc.)
* add a snapper configuration script to "util"
