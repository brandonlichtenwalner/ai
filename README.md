# Arch Install #
A simple set of bash scripts to automate the installation of Arch Linux.
Authored for my own personal use and kept simple.


## TODO ##
* Move "desktop" files into a separate subdirectory instead of being in with "environments"
* Split "desktop" files into smaller files (e.g. common, cups, steam, gtk, qt, etc.)
