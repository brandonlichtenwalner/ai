## Arch Install ##
A simple set of bash scripts to automate the installation of Arch Linux.
Authored for my own personal use and kept (relatively) simple.

#### TODO ####
* move "desktop" files into a separate subdirectory instead of being in with "environments"
* split "desktop" files into smaller files (e.g. common, cups, steam, gtk, qt, etc.)
* add additional options to AUR helper files
* update post-install.txt with options to install items from scripts repo and other optional items
