After starting Enlightenment for the first time and going through setup, you will also need to do the following (for each user):

1 - Settings > All > Look > Application Theme: Select the Adwaita GTK theme and make sure both boxes are checked. Select the GNOME icon theme and make sure only the top box is checked.
2 - Settings > All > Apps > Startup Applications: Under the "System" tab add Certificate and Key Storage, GPG Password Agent, LXPolkit, Print Queue Applet, SSH Key Agent, and Secret Storage Service (also Network if using wifi)
3 - Add the following to ~/.profile
if [ -n "$DESKTOP_SESSION" ];then 
  # No point to start gnome-keyring-daemon if ssh-agent is not up 
  if [ -n "$SSH_AGENT_PID" ];then 
    eval $(gnome-keyring-daemon --start) 
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK export GPG_AGENT_INFO
    export GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL
  fi
fi

numlockx on

4 - Add the following to ~/.bashrc
PATH="${PATH}:~/bin"
